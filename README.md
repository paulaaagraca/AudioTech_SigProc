## Signal Processing for Audio Technology 

This repository contains a set of exercises of signal processing applied to audio related tasks.

All programs are written in MATLAB code.


### Assignment 1 - Audio I/O
Test and modulation of sound using a M-AUDIO FAST TRACK C400 audio device for real-time processing, allowing to record and listen sound at the same time.

### Assignment 2 - Filters
Design of both FIR and IIR filters, testing many windowing methods and analysing linear responses.

### Assignment 3 - Audio Effects
Creation of offline and real-time audio effects, with the respective spectral analysis.
* Vibrato
* Flanger
* Overdrive
* Distortion

### Assignment 4 - Dynamic Range Control
Creation of a real-time block of dynamic range control for an input audio signal. 

It uses level estimation (RMS or Peak Level Detection), a static curve and gain smoothing with customizable parameters.

### Assignment 6 - Feedback Delay Networks
Creation of a third order SISO Feedback Delay Networks that silumates late reverberation in rooms. 

Filtering is used in order to improve the reverberation quality.
